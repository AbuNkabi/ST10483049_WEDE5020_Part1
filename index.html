    <p>PEP Stores is a multinational retail company; they have different retail stores (cell, home) and they offer a vast range of products and services, from clothing to sending packages around South Africa. According to online sources, their main aim is to become South Africa’s single brand retailer to provide affordable goods and services to low-income customers (PEP Stores, 2023). PEP is more than just a store – they also provide scholarships under PEP Academy as well as partnerships with organisations such as the Do More Foundation (PEP Stores, 2023).

        “To be the best place to WORK, the best place to SHOP, and the best place to INVEST” (PEP Stores, 2023).
        
        They have a clothing retail arm, a store that sells electronics, a place that sells household goods, and a service that can send parcels called PAXI (PEP Stores, 2023). Above all these services they also have goals. These are achieved by offering customer-focused retail, fostering a unique culture, and empowering communities. The company does all this by being a customer-focused retailer, meaning they make sure people can easily get the important things they need at prices they can actually afford. It’s about making life a little easier and better for customers and the communities around them (Ehlers, n.d.).
        
        The Sikhula KunYe (“growing together”) culture is all about working as a team and treating each other with dignity and respect. It’s about being resourceful, supporting one another, and creating an environment where people can grow and feel cared for (PEP Stores, 2023).
        
        PEP also works to empower communities through things like the PEP Academy and other projects. These focus mainly on education, especially for young kids, and aim to improve the overall quality of life in the communities they serve (PEP Stores, 2023).
        
        Pep Stores have a number of websites all over the internet, including its well-known brand presence and affordable product range. Their websites are mostly easy to navigate and shop for what you need. With the strengths that they have, Pep can always improve some things from their side: they have designs that lack up-to-date styles and feature outdated visuals; they sometimes advertise products that they do not produce in real life; and their quality is not always as good as advertised, which affects customer trust (Krug, 2014; Nielsen and Budiu, 2012). The website research function and filtering options are limited, making it difficult for shoppers to get what they want quickly. Mobile optimisation could also be improved for smoother browsing on smartphones, as most people prefer to shop online (W3C, 2023; Interaction Design Foundation, 2023). They can always improve the above to make their services more accurate and reliable.
